# THIS REPOSITORY HAS BEEN DEPRECIATED

As of September 22 2021, I will no longer be actively maintaining this repository. The main reason is that I feel that the solution is too complex for its own good and that it could had been implemented in a simpler fashion. I do have plans to revisit Adstandards web scraping at a later date but I'm not entirely sure when I will get around to it. Once I have an active repository, I will link it here.

# Adstandards Archive Backend

This is a Node JS command line application used to scrape and archive advertising complaint case reports from [Adstandards Australia](https://adstandards.com.au). I wrote this program as an exercise in software development, database design, web scraping, and archiving public information.

## What is Adstandards?
To quote their website:

>Ad Standards manages the complaint resolution process of the advertising self-regulation system. Our vision is to be Australiaâ€™s community voice for complaints about advertising and marketing standards. Our purpose is to give a voice to consumer values and guide industry in maintaining decent and honest advertising aligning with prevailing community standards.

\-Retrieved 11 January 2021 ([Full text](https://adstandards.com.au/about/ad-standards))

Adstandards enables members of the general public to submit complaints regarding advertisements that can be considered offensive in some way. These complaints are then reviewed by a community panel to assess whether they are justified based on prevailing community values. Reports of these complaints and their outcomes are then [published](https://adstandards.com.au/cases) on their website for public viewing.

## Getting Started
After downloading a local copy of the project, open a terminal inside the root folder and run `npm install`. Afterwards, run `node archive` to confirm that the program has been installed and to see a list of supported commands.

The different tasks of this program have been split into several commands so that data archiving can be executed in steps and not just as one huge action. Furthermore, tasks that are likely to take a long time can be aborted and resumed later on as desired.

Here is a table of the main archive commands in suggested order of execution:

| Command          | Description                                                                 |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| create           | Creates and initialises the archive database.                               |
| read-lists       | Downloads and saves product category and media type list data into archive. |
| download-pages   | Downloads page .html files from adstandards.                                |
